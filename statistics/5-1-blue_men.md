[Think Stats Chapter 5 Exercise 1](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2006.html#toc50) (blue men)


The question is asking what percentage of the United States population falls within the height requirements for blue man group.  

It seems it is more appropriate for a confidence interval in this case.  And for fun I will apply it to each critical z.  

For reference please see the  ipython notebook file named "For Computation"

My answers: 
```
% 34.27 Can be Blue Men


Lower bound is:  (0.47, 0.51) CI 95%
Upper bound is:  (0.81, 0.86) CI 95%
```
